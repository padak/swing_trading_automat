6. Potential Points to Confirm

Although the plan appears solid, you may want to verify:

Manager Worker Threads:
 - Do PriceManager, OrderManager, and StateManager each start exactly one thread, or do they spin additional sub-threads? Make sure all threads get stopped cleanly.

Database Commits:
 - If you have pending transactions, is a short 2-second join enough time to finish them? If not, consider increasing this or ensuring graceful commits happen quickly.

Logging Final State:
 - The plan references final logs during shutdown. Verify that the final logs are flushed before forcing exit so you don’t lose crucial debugging info.

Local vs. Production Differences:
 - If your developer does local testing with short sleeps, ensure production logs and sleeps are also kept short. Sometimes people accidentally leave “time.sleep(10)” in a debug environment, leading to slow shutdowns.

As long as those details are addressed in the final implementation, it looks like your developer has thoroughly resolved the concerns raised in “init-run-help-o1.md” and is adhering to “PRODUCTION_DESIGN.md.”
