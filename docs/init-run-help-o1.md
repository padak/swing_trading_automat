Here are the main issues and recommended fixes for the new errors you’re seeing, particularly the "'OrderManager' object has no attribute 'logger'" error and the unexpected behavior around placing SELL orders.

---

## 1. The “OrderManager object has no attribute 'logger'” Error

From your logs:
"callback": "handle_order_update", "error": "'OrderManager' object has no attribute 'logger'"
This indicates that somewhere in order_manager.py, code now references self.logger (for example, self.logger.debug(…)) but your OrderManager class never defines a “logger” instance attribute.

To fix it:

1) In order_manager.py, import your logging function (e.g., from src.config.logging_config import get_logger) or use Python’s standard logging.getLogger(__name__).  
2) In the OrderManager constructor (def __init__():), set self.logger to that logger instance.

Below is a minimal example (showing only key lines) for order_manager.py:

python:src/core/order_manager.py
```
from src.config.logging_config import get_logger
class OrderManager:
"""
Order manager for handling buy/sell operations and tracking positions.
"""
def init(self, price_manager, state_manager) -> None:
"""
Initialize an OrderManager instance.
Args:
price_manager (PriceManager): The component handling price updates.
state_manager (StateManager): The component handling state persistence.
"""
self.logger = get_logger(name) # or logging.getLogger(name)
self.price_manager = price_manager
self.state_manager = state_manager
# ... other initializations ...
def handle_order_update(self, order_data: dict) -> None:
"""
Process incoming order updates from the WebSocket or REST fallback.
Args:
order_data (dict): The raw data describing the order update.
"""
self.logger.debug("handle_order_update called", extra={"order_data": order_data})
# ... rest of your order handling logic ...
```


Make sure all code references use self.logger. The error will disappear once “self.logger” actually exists in OrderManager.

## 2. Verify the SELL Placement Logic

Even after fixing the logger, if you still aren’t seeing SELL orders, confirm the following:

1. Your BUY is recognized as “FILLED” in OrderManager:  
   - Check if you receive a status == "FILLED" with side == "BUY" in the handle_order_update function (or whichever callback processes final fill events).  
   - The code path that calls place_sell_order(...) must be triggered only when we know the fill is a BUY.

2. The fill quantity is above the minimum lot size:  
   - If you are buying a small amount (like 1 USDC worth at a high price), you might fall below the exchange’s minimum SELL quantity. If that’s the case, your code may skip SELL placement, possibly logging “Not placing SELL - below minimum quantity.”

3. The price logic is correct:  
   - Some Binance order updates have an “avgPrice” or “last_filled_price” field instead of “price.” Verify that you use the correct field to calculate your SELL target price.

4. The order is actually stored in the database with side="BUY"  
   - If your code tried to find the order by ID and can’t find it (or sees a null side), you won’t get a valid SELL event.  

Make sure your logs confirm each step. For instance, after a fill, you should see something like:

• “BUY order filled, preparing SELL order”  
• “Calculated SELL target price …”  
• “Successfully placed SELL order …”

If you don’t see those log lines, you know the code is skipping or failing the “BUY fill => SELL” logic.

## 3. Stuck Shutdown or Signal Handling

If your script still refuses to stop (a separate but common issue), confirm that each manager’s .stop() method actually returns. Sometimes a thread or a while-loop inside PriceManager or OrderManager can block the shutdown sequence, preventing os._exit(0) from executing. Add debug logs right before and after self.order_manager.stop(), etc., to verify you return promptly.

---

## 4. Next Steps for the Junior Developer

1. Define self.logger in OrderManager (and any other classes that now reference self.logger).  
2. Double-check that handle_order_update sees the correct side == "BUY" and status == "FILLED."  
3. Confirm the code logs each step of the buy-fill → sell-creation pathway, so you can see exactly why a SELL may or may not be placed.  
4. If the script still fails to exit on Ctrl-C, sprinkle debug logs in each .stop() method (PriceManager, OrderManager, StateManager) to confirm they finish.

By adding a logger instance to OrderManager and carefully verifying the SELL creation logic and order data, you should eliminate the new errors and ensure the trading workflow (BUY → detect fill → place SELL) behaves as expected.


RE: STOPPING

Below is a guide on where your script most likely gets stuck, along with suggestions to help you finally stop it in response to Ctrl+C. Though your logs show that multiple shutdown signals are received and the system state is persisted for “STOPPED,” it fails to exit fully. That means your code never actually exits after handling the signal.

---

## 1. Verify Each Manager’s “stop()” Method Actually Returns

∙ Inspect all references to “stop()” in PriceManager, OrderManager, StateManager, and confirm each one:  
  1) Sets a “running = False” (or similar) flag in that component.  
  2) Breaks out of any while loop or run() method that is otherwise blocking.  
  3) Does not wait indefinitely for a library callback that never returns.  

For instance, if your PriceManager’s run() has:

```
while self.running:
# WebSocket read or some logic
```

…then in stop(), you must do:
```
self.running = False # So that loop will exit
```

and also forcibly close sockets if needed.

If you fail to exit that loop, the thread remains alive, and the main program won’t reach the final os._exit(0).

---

## 2. Confirm You Actually Reach The “finally” Clause

In main.py’s shutdown() method, you have a try/except/finally with:
```
finally:
self.logger.info("All components stopped, calling os.exit(0)")
os.exit(0)
```

If the code is stuck inside the try block (for example, your manager.stop() method never returns), you never get to that finally block.

∙ Add debug logs after each manager.stop() call. For example:
```
python
self.logger.debug("Stopping Price Manager...")
self.price_manager.stop()
self.logger.debug("Price Manager stop() returned")
```


If you never see “Price Manager stop() returned,” that’s your smoking gun: the code is stuck in stop(). It can’t reach the final block that calls os._exit(0).

---

## 3. Thread or Event Loop Deadlock

Many WebSocket or async frameworks can block indefinitely if not signaled to close properly. For instance, lingering threads or event loops may ignore run-loop statements or require an explicit close() call.

∙ If you use websocket-client, confirm that you’ve done something like:

```
self.ws.close()
```

in your stop() method. Then confirm that the background thread that calls ws.run_forever() actually receives that closure call.

∙ If you use asyncio, you may need:
```
loop.stop()
loop.close()
```

Depending on how you set it up, signals might not propagate properly to the event loop unless everything’s orchestrated with the built-in asynchronous signal handling.

---

## 4. Double-Check “Duration Monitoring” Threads

From the snippet in OrderManager, it looks like you have a self.duration_monitor_thread that checks position durations. If that thread never sees the “running = False” condition, it may keep looping. That can block the final shutdown.

Make sure:
1. You set self.running = False in stop().  
2. That thread’s loop checks self.running on each iteration:
   ```python
   while self.running:
       self._check_position_durations(...)
       time.sleep(...)
   ```
3. If it never breaks out, it won’t join() properly.

---

## 5. Potential Logging Silences

Sometimes you see “System state persisted for shutdown” because you updated the state in the DB, but the actual code that calls os._exit(0) is never hit. That’s often because the try block or a subthread is still busy.

Try this:

1. Place a debug log right before os._exit(0):  
   ```python
   self.logger.debug("About to call os._exit(0)...")
   ```
2. If you don’t see that in the logs, you know you’re never reaching that line.

---

## 6. Try a “Hard Timeout” or “Forceful Approach” (Not Ideal)

If you cannot find the offending stop() call that blocks, you can forcibly exit after a timeout:
```
import threading
def shutdown(self):
if not self.running:
return
self.running = False
def do_shutdown():
try:
self.order_manager.stop()
self.price_manager.stop()
self.state_manager.stop()
except Exception as e:
self.logger.error("Error during shutdown", exc_info=True)
finally:
self.logger.info("Forceful exit now")
os.exit(0)
t = threading.Thread(target=do_shutdown)
t.start()
t.join(timeout=5) # 5 second timeout
if t.is_alive():
self.logger.warning("Shutdown timed out. Exiting anyway.")
os.exit(1)
```


This forcibly kills the process even if a manager’s stop() method is hung. But the better fix is to identify and fix the blocking call.

---

## 7. Summary of Likely Causes

1. A subthread or while-loop in one of the managers never sees the “running = False” or otherwise fails to exit.  
2. The code never returns from manager.stop(), so the main thread can’t reach the final os._exit(0).  
3. A library function doesn’t close properly (websocket, asyncio loop, etc.).  

Your next steps:

1) Add debug logs in each manager.stop() method before/after loops or library calls.  
2) Confirm each thread’s run() loop is conditioned on “while self.running.”  
3) If something still blocks, add a small forced timeout approach so you can see exactly which manager is hooking the exit.

Once you ensure each manager and thread truly stops promptly, you’ll see the final “All components stopped, calling os._exit(0)” log and the script will terminate on Ctrl+C as expected.
